This Python Module provide user several methods to more easily interface with
I2C devices using any embedded ARM SBC; typically the Raspberry Pi.

This module was first based off the Adafruit I2C.py module and then changes
were made to fit the needs of the various robotics projects based on the CoroBot
Spark and other CoroBot platforms.
